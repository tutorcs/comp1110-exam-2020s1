     * "Homer", who has children named "Lisa" and "Bart":

     * getAncestry(homer, "Bart") returns "Bart born of Homer"; and
     * getAncestry(homer, "Homer") returns "Homer"; and
     * getAncestry(homer, "Barney") returns null
     * <p>
     * Note: each individual has only one parent in the family tree.
