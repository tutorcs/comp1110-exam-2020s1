 * <p>
 * This class represents a wiki: a collection of linked articles that is
 * contributed to by multiple editors.
 * In this wiki, each article has a unique ID (integer), a name (String) and a
 * category (String). Multiple articles may have the same category.
 * Articles may link to other articles in the wiki; each article has at most
 * one link to each other article.
 * Each article also has a set of editors (the users who have edited the
 * article). An editor is represented by their username (String),
 * and each editor may have edited zero or more articles.
