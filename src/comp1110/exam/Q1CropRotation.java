     * Get all valid crop rotations that can be composed from the provided
     * set of vegetable crops for the given number of seasons.
     * A crop rotation is a sequence of vegetable crops to plant.
     * One crop is planted per season, and any crop may be planted at most once.
     * Crops must be planted in order of their Group according to the following
     * rules:
     * - a LEGUME may only be followed by a BRASSICA;
     * - a BRASSICA may only be followed by an ALLIUM;
     * - an ALLIUM may only be followed by a FRUITING crop; and
     * - a FRUITING crop may only be followed by a LEGUME.
     * <p>
     * For example, the call
     * getAllRotations([Tomato (fruiting), Onion (allium)], 2)
     * returns a set containing a single rotation:
     * - [Onion (allium), Tomato (fruiting)]
     * because an ALLIUM may only be followed by a fruiting crop.
     * <p>
     * The call
     * getAllRotations([Tomato (fruiting), Kale (brassica), Onion (allium), Pea (legume)], 4)
     * returns a set containing four rotations:
     * - [Kale (brassica), Onion (allium), Tomato (fruiting), Pea (legume)]
     * - [Onion (allium), Tomato (fruiting), Pea (legume), Kale (brassica)]
     * - [Pea (legume), Kale (brassica), Onion (allium), Tomato (fruiting)]
     * - [Tomato (fruiting), Pea (legume), Kale (brassica), Onion (allium)]
     * <p>
     * If no valid crop rotation can be found, an empty list is returned.
     * For example, the call:
     * getAllRotations([Tomato (fruiting), Gai Lan (brassica)], 2)
     * returns an empty set, because a FRUITING crop cannot be followed by
     * a BRASSICA, and a BRASSICA cannot be followed by a FRUITING crop.
     *
     * @param crops   the set of vegetable crops from which to construct a rotation
     * @param seasons the number of seasons
     * @return the set of all possible rotations of the provided crops for the
     * given number of seasons
