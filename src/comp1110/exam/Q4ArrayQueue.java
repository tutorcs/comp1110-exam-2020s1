/**
 * COMP1110/6710 Exam, Question 4
 * <p>
 * This class represents a queue, in which elements are added and removed in a
 * first in, first out (FIFO) order. Duplicate elements are permitted.
 * When a queue is first created, it contains no elements.
 * The queue can grow to fit new elements as required.
 * Attempting to access an element of an empty queue throws an EmptyQueueException,
 * and does not result in any modification to the queue.
 * The Queue is implemented using an array data structure (a regular Java array),
 * and does not use any of the Java Collection classes.
