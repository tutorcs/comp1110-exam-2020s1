    /**
     * Solve a Sudoku puzzle.
     * A Sudoku puzzle consists of the numbers 1-9 arranged in a 9x9 grid,
     * divided into nine 3x3 subgrids.
     * In a valid solution for the puzzle, each of the numbers 1-9 appears only
     * once in each row, column and subgrid. For example, the following is a
     * valid solution:
     * -------------------------
     * | 5 8 1 | 9 4 7 | 6 3 2 |
     * | 3 7 6 | 8 1 2 | 5 9 4 |
     * | 9 2 4 | 3 5 6 | 7 8 1 |
     * -------------------------
     * | 6 5 7 | 2 8 9 | 1 4 3 |
     * | 1 3 8 | 6 7 4 | 2 5 9 |
     * | 2 4 9 | 1 3 5 | 8 7 6 |
     * -------------------------
     * | 8 9 3 | 7 6 1 | 4 2 5 |
     * | 4 6 2 | 5 9 8 | 3 1 7 |
     * | 7 1 5 | 4 2 3 | 9 6 8 |
     * -------------------------
     * <p>
     * whereas the following partial layout is not valid, because the number
     * 5 appears twice in the upper-left subgrid.
     * ---------------
     * | 5 8 1 | 3 ...
     * | 3 7 2 | 4 ...
     * | 4 5 6 | 1 ...
     * ---------------
     * |  ...  |   ...
     * <p>
     * The puzzle is specified as a 9x9 array of integers which holds the rows
     * and columns of numbers in each cell of the puzzle.
     * For example, the number in the second row and third column of the puzzle
     * is held in array element a[1][2].
     * If the setup gives zero for a number, it means that value for that cell
     * is not specified, and must be solved. In other words, zero must be
     * replaced with a number 1-9 to create a valid solution.
     * <p>
     * For example, the following is one possible setup for the valid solution
     * given above:
     * -------------------------
     * | 0 0 1 | 9 4 7 | 0 0 0 |
     * | 3 7 6 | 8 1 2 | 0 9 0 |
     * | 9 2 4 | 3 5 0 | 0 0 0 |
     * -------------------------
     * | 0 5 7 | 0 0 9 | 1 0 0 |
     * | 1 3 8 | 6 0 4 | 2 5 9 |
     * | 0 0 9 | 1 0 0 | 8 7 0 |
     * -------------------------
     * | 0 0 3 | 0 6 1 | 4 2 5 |
     * | 0 6 0 | 5 9 8 | 3 1 7 |
     * | 0 0 0 | 4 2 3 | 9 0 0 |
     * -------------------------
     * <p>
     * To solve the puzzle, each zero must be replaced with a number 1-9 so as to
     * create a valid solution.
     *
     * @param setup a 9x9 array of integers 0-9, where 0 represents a value to be solved
     * @return a valid solution for the given setup
