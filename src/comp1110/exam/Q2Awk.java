     * Read the specified input file in comma-separated-value (CSV) format and
     * extract all values from the specified column, writing the values
     * (one per line) to the specified output file.
     * If sortOutput==true, the values in the specified column are written in
     * alphabetical order to the output file; otherwise, the values are written
     * in the same order as they occur in the input file.
     * If the specified column is missing a value for a given line, then that
     * line is ignored and is not included in the output.
     * If the specified column is not included in any line of the input file,
     * then the output file is empty.
     * <p>
     * For example, if the input file "Q2kate.csv" contains the following lines:
     * Babooshka,1980,2
     * Hounds of Love,1986,
     * Rubberband Girl,1993,39
     * Running Up That Hill,1983,6
     * Wuthering Heights,1978,1
     * then the method call extractColumnCSV("Q2kate.csv", 2, "chart.csv", true)
     * would result in the following lines being written to the file "chart.csv":
     * 1
     * 2
     * 39
     * 6
     *
     * @param inputFilename  the filename of the input file
     * @param column         the number of the column to extract (0..n)
     * @param outputFilename the filename of the output file
     * @param sortOutput     if true, the specified column is written to the output
     *                       file in alphabetical order
     * @throws java.nio.file.NoSuchFileException if the input file does not exist or
     *                                           the output file cannot be created
